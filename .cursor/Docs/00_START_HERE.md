## 🎯 YOUR IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS

### **Cursor Says Code is Ready? Here's What to Do:**

```
❌ DON'T: Deploy immediately to production
✅ DO: Follow this sequence:

1. DEPLOYMENT_READY.md
   → Read this first (10 minutes)
   → Understand the process
   → Know what's ahead

2. PRE_DEPLOYMENT_VALIDATION.md
   → Work through EVERY checklist (2-3 hours)
   → Verify code quality
   → Test security
   → Check integrations
   → Create database backup
   
3. ONLY AFTER VALIDATION IS 100% COMPLETE:
   → Schedule deployment time
   → Follow DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md
   → Monitor with POST_DEPLOYMENT_MONITORING.md

4. IF ANYTHING GOES WRONG:
   → Use ROLLBACK_PROCEDURE.md
```

---

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: DO NOT SKIP VALIDATION

**Even though Cursor AI generated production-ready code, you MUST:**

- [ ] Verify TypeScript compiles (0 errors)
- [ ] Run all tests (all passing)
- [ ] Check security configuration
- [ ] Test payment integrations
- [ ] Create database backup
- [ ] Set all environment variables
- [ ] Test in staging first

**Why?** Because:
- Environment-specific issues exist
- Secrets need configuration
- External services need testing
- Database migrations need verification
- Team needs coordination
